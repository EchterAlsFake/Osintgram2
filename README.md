# What is Osintgram 2.0? 

Osintgram is a tool made for analyzing the instagram account of someone.
<Br>It can automatically get all location data, captions, and other useful information
<br>It was intended to be used by cybersecurity experts.

It's based on the [Osintgram](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) created by Datalux, which is sadly unmaintained for
<br>years and currently not working.

# Instagram ToS

Instagram PROHIBITS the use of automated tools and the use of
<br>their Private API. I got banned from Instagram with multiple of
<br>my test accounts!  ALWAYS USE A DUMMY OR FAKE ACCOUNT!!!
