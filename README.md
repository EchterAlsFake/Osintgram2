# What is Osintgram 2.0? 

Osintgram is a tool made for analyzing the instagram account of someone.
<Br>It can automatically get all location data, captions, and other useful information
<br>It was intended to be used by cybersecurity experts.

It's based on the [Osintgram](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) created by Datalux, which is sadly unmaintained for
<br>years and currently not working.

# Instagram ToS
