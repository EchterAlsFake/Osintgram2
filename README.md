# Osintgram 2ðŸ”ŽðŸ“¸

##### A *OSINT* Tool for anonymous advanced information gathering
##### Based on the great [Osintgram](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) from Datalux
# Information:

This project is currently not at my highest priority.
<br>Some features may not work correctly and there might be some logical flaws.

I can fix it in approximately 1-2 weeks :) 
<br>Thanks for your patience

(I am working on a way to load the media objects with a delay, so that you don't get timed out.)
