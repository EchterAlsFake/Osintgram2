# Prevent Instagram Account bans

Instagram has a lot of limitations since the Osintgram by Datalux.

Try the following if you get errors, related to the API, login or loading objects:

- Change IP (NO VPN, restart router instead)
- Change device fingerprint
- Change User Agent
- Login with Browser, and use the Session ID from developer settings
- Use different Account
- Add 2FA to your account
- Change Delay of API actions

While developing, I am using over 15 different Accounts and over 10 different IP addresses.
<br>It's hard, but possible!
