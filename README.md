# What is Osintgram 2.0? 

There is a tool called Osintgram developed from Datalux. It was a tool to 
<br>get information about targets with Instagram's Private API.

Sadly the API he used is no longer maintained, and some endpoints from
<br>Instagram are no longer valid. That's why I decided to make my own
<br>version with the Instagrapi API. It's not as fast and good like from 
<br> Datalux, but it should be good enough to do the basic things...

# Instagram ToS

Instagram PROHIBITS the use of automated tools and the use of
<br>their Private API. I got banned from Instagram with multiple of
<br>my test accounts!  ALWAYS USE A DUMMY OR FAKE ACCOUNT!!!
